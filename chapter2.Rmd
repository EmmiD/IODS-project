# Regression and model validation


Data of this study includes basic information about the students of a statistic course, their attitude, different kind of learning types and academic success. Data are available from 166 students. Questions considering different learning types have been combined into combination variables called deep, surface and strategic learning. Other variables are gender, age, attitude and exam points.




- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods.
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using.
